# bdh-hermes-bridge

Bidirectional bridge between [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) and [BDH Graph Harness](https://github.com/albidev/bdh-graph-harness).

Feeds Hermes session knowledge into BDH's neural graph, and exposes BDH context as tools Hermes can query.

## About

**BDH Hermes Bridge** is a plugin that connects Hermes Agent (an autonomous AI assistant) with BDH Graph Harness (a knowledge graph implementing biological neural network analogies from the [Dragon Hatchling paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26507)).

The core idea: every conversation with Hermes becomes training data for a living knowledge graph. The graph learns from real usage — not fabricated queries — and grows organically through:

- **Hebbian learning** — neurons that fire together wire together
- **Neurogenesis** — new concepts born from conversation gaps
- **Quality propagation** — activation scores ripple through the network
- **Dormancy** — unused connections fade, keeping the graph clean

Hermes, in turn, can query the graph for context it wouldn't otherwise have — surfacing connections between projects, past decisions, and technical knowledge buried in the vault.

**This isn't a RAG pipeline.** It's a neural memory system that learns *what matters* by observing real interactions.

### Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Neurons | Vault notes — atomic knowledge units |
| Wikilink synapses | `[[wiki/links]]` between notes |
| Hebbian synapses | Learned associations from co-activation |
| Neurogenesis | New note creation when the graph detects knowledge gaps |
| Dormancy | Low-quality nodes marked for pruning |

## What it does

### Write path — Hermes → BDH

After every substantial LLM response (`post_api_request` hook, `finish_reason == "stop"`), the plugin sends the response content to BDH's `/api/query` endpoint. This triggers:

- **Hebbian reinforcement** — co-activated neurons strengthen their synaptic links
- **Neurogenesis** — if the LLM response contains genuinely new concepts, BDH creates atomic notes in the vault
- **Quality updates** — activation scores propagate through the graph

Only fires on responses >200 chars (skips trivial acks like "done", "pushato").

#### Echo-loop prevention

The write path uses the **user message** as the embedding seed (query), not the assistant response. The assistant response is passed as `user_prompt` for LLM/neurogenesis context only. This prevents echo loops where embedding the response finds notes similar to what the graph already contains, reinforcing existing connections rather than discovering new ones.

Additionally, the payload includes `source: "assistant_response"` which triggers dampened Hebbian learning (frequency += 0.3 instead of 1.0) to further prevent feedback amplification.

#### User context capture

The `pre_llm_call` hook captures the last user message, which is included in write payloads alongside the assistant response. This creates proper question→answer synaptic associations that would otherwise be lost.

### Read path — BDH → Hermes

Two tools registered for Hermes to query the knowledge graph:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bdh_query` | Query BDH with a question. Returns activated neurons, LLM response, and any new concepts created. |
| `bdh_stats` | Quick graph stats: neuron count, active/dormant, synapses, hebbian links. |

When BDH is unreachable (e.g. during sleep-cycle consolidation), `bdh_query` returns a graceful fallback message instead of crashing the agent.

### Resilience

All BDH HTTP requests use retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s). This handles transient failures during BDH's consolidation cycles without dropping data.

## Requirements

- [BDH Graph Harness](https://github.com/albidev/bdh-graph-harness) running on `localhost:8643`
- Hermes Agent with plugin support (gateway mode)

## Install

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/albidev/bdh-hermes-bridge.git ~/.hermes/plugins/bdh-hermes-bridge

# Or symlink from a dev repo
ln -s ~/Projects/bdh-hermes-bridge ~/.hermes/plugins/bdh-hermes-bridge
```

Enable in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - bdh-hermes-bridge
```

Restart the gateway:

```bash
hermes gateway restart
```

## How it works

The graph grows organically from real usage — no fabricated queries, no noise.

## Hooks used

| Hook | When | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `pre_llm_call` | Before LLM generates | Capture user message for write path context |
| `post_api_request` | After API response (stop) | Feed assistant response + user context to BDH |
